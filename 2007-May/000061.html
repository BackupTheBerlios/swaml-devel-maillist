+1 - apparently there is support for including these properties in SIOC core.
Sergio, is that OK with you?

I've added these properties to the &quot;work&quot; version [1] of the SIOC
ontology. Will publish it once we have agreed on the details. Property
names (according to SIOC naming convention): next_by_date and
previous_by_date. Please look at their descriptions and suggest
improvements.

&gt;<i> It also fits well with the new &quot;Thread&quot; container that aims to order posts.
</I>
Thread does not really order posts, it just groups them. Please find
some comments on sorting posts at the end of this email.

&gt;<i> BTW, what about making this property an owl:TransitiveProperty ?
</I>&gt;<i> Could be useful for reasoners.
</I>
Done. Can it cause any problems? There were some OWL changes to FOAF
ontology (can't remember what exactly) which were later commented out
due to some problems.

&gt;<i> Finaly, re. the names of the properties: won't previous / next be enough ?
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, it can be previousByAlphabeticOrder or something else, but in
</I>&gt;<i> the case of posts, previous / next &quot;natural&quot; meaning is chronological,
</I>&gt;<i> so maybe the short name is enough.
</I>
&quot;next_by_date&quot; adds useful context, important to understanding how and
why are these items ordered.

In any case, next_by_date / previous_by_date acts as a &quot;shortcut&quot; or a
way of describing results of sorting performed on some container. A
more elaborate way to express sorting on a container would be to
define a &quot;sort_by&quot; property. It could then point to a property [which
data creator suggests] to sort by (e.g., dcterms:created).

How does AtomOWL handle sorting of things?

&quot;Representing Order in RDF&quot; [2] gives an good overview of different
ways how order can be represented in RDF. That may also give some
ideas.
