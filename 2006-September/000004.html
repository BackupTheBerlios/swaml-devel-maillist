Hi, Sergio.

I see a great opportunity to enhance SWAML by aligning it under the SIOC
umbrella. SIOC provides a mature and well defined vocabulary for SWAML
to use. It also broadens the scope of SWAML, by extending the scope of
the vocabulary beyond the mailing lists. Opportunities to further
development of SWAML in the next years are supported by the critical
mass (and funds) behind SIOC. Additionally, SIOC currently has a number
of applications (such as a Firefox plugin, a browser, a query
interface...) that can be automatically re-used for SWAML.

So, in my opinion, SIOC is very interesting for SWAML. With respect to
the three options above, I would choose the second one. As with FOAF and
DC, there is no good reason to re-invent an ontology if there exists a
mature alternative that suits. It seems to me that only minor changes in
the SWAML code will be required to use the SIOC classes and properties.

I think it is also important to keep in touch with the SIOC developers,
probably subscribing to their mailing list, and to report your advances
to them. It is very important to avoid any effort duplication, since
they have also considered the usage of SIOC for mailing lists (see [1],
a different approach to the same question). Make sure they know about
your project.

Regards,
