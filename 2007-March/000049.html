The International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries (ICADL) is one of
the leading international conferences in digital libraries research. ICADL
2007 will provide a forum for sharing ideas, research results and
experiences in digital libraries, related technologies and associated
practical and social issues. Participants from diverse backgrounds are
encouraged. Previous conferences have included practitioners, researchers,
educators and policy makers from a variety of disciplines such as computer
science/information technology, library and information sciences, archival
and museum studies, knowledge management, and many areas in the social
sciences and humanities.

Into its tenth year, the theme of ICADL 2007 will be &quot;Asian Digital
libraries: Looking Back 10 Years and Forging New Frontiers&quot;.  In line with
this theme, we are soliciting papers that examine the history and
development of digital libraries, especially projects in the Asian region,
as well as papers that discuss future developments and cutting-edge
technologies in digital libraries. Submissions focusing on other digital
library areas are also welcome and may include research, system,
evaluation, policy and position papers. Topics include but are not limited
to:

* digital library infrastructure and architecture
* information retrieval, filtering and extraction
* data/text/Web mining
* text summarization
* multilingual information processing
* interoperability issues
* open source tools and frameworks for digital libraries
* mobile services
* human-computer interaction
* user interfaces and visualization
* user communities
* social media/Web 2.0 technologies
* metadata and cataloging
* taxonomy, ontology and the semantic Web
* digital preservation
