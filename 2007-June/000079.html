<PRE>El mar, 19-06-2007 a las 18:10 +0000, Alvaro del Castillo escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> My knowledge about SPARQL endpoints is very limited right now but as fas
</I>&gt;<i> as I know it is a web service offering a SPARQL query service. Is it
</I>&gt;<i> right? Do you have in mind the technologies you are going to use to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it? I suppose you just need to receive the web service query
</I>&gt;<i> and use RDFLib SPARQL implementation to do the query. Then you need to
</I>&gt;<i> return the results from RDFLib SPARQL in the format the web service will
</I>&gt;<i> implement.
</I>
Unfortunately it seems that there is no implementation of the SPARQL
endpoint machinery in Python at the moment, neither the client nor the
server. As you said, an SPARQL endpoint is just a web service (either
SOAP-based or HTTP-based). I don't think we can afford building a good
Python implementation of SPARQL endpoints, although I admit it would be
an interesting project by itself! Therefore, we are studying other
options, maybe interfacing with other languages like Java.

&gt;<i> In QualiPSo project next week we will go to Italy for a meeting and we
</I>&gt;<i> will present there SWAML project as an example of the way we could
</I>&gt;<i> follow to cover our information sources.
</I>
Thanks for the reference. Don't hesitate to cite some of our published
papers on SWAML when you write some documentation. We would be very
grateful!

&gt;<i> We are also studying right now:

Nice! I wasn't aware of this project. It seems a bit inmature, but looks
very promising! 

Best regards,
