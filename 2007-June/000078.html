<PRE>hi!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The memory usage with large archives could be an issue to have in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account. With the URL above currently the memory usage is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 32162 acs       15   0  101m  62m  10m S  0.0  5.0   0:57.62 python2.4
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Alvaro, all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we are aware that there is a problem with memory comsumption. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, SWAML reads the whole mbox file into memory, which is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> unacceptable for large mailing lists. We will explore some paths to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid this. Probably it shouldn't be difficult to process the mbox file
</I>&gt;<i> as a stream, and retaining in memory just the information required to
</I>&gt;<i> wire the links between messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have seen also that you have added &quot;apps/prototypes/sparql-endpoint&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you plan to start working in the sparql-endpoint then? Do you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; roadmap for it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, we are working on this now. Our idea is to add to Buxon the
</I>&gt;<i> feature of being able to query remote SPARQL endpoints (instead of
</I>&gt;<i> fetching the RDF files). At the same time, we are trying to add an
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint server to SWAML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
My knowledge about SPARQL endpoints is very limited right now but as fas
as I know it is a web service offering a SPARQL query service. Is it
right? Do you have in mind the technologies you are going to use to
implement it? I suppose you just need to receive the web service query
and use RDFLib SPARQL implementation to do the query. Then you need to
return the results from RDFLib SPARQL in the format the web service will
implement.

In QualiPSo project next week we will go to Italy for a meeting and we
will present there SWAML project as an example of the way we could
follow to cover our information sources.

We are also studying right now:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/baetle/">http://code.google.com/p/baetle/</A>

to analyze our ontologies and reuse as much as possible other ontologies
that are already in use like SIOC, FOAF, DOAP and maybe Baetle.

Our main goal is the &quot;Definition and prototyping of information
management tools required for the collaborative platform&quot; (think in CDE
like GForge and in someway Trac) and thinking in a semantic
collaborative platform seems to be a very interesting path to explore.

Kind regards!

&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>
