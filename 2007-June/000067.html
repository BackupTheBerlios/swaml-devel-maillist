&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>
Hi,

&gt;<i> My name is Alvaro del Castillo and I am coordinating the QualiPSo
</I>&gt;<i> A4 activity in URJC GSyC/LibreSoft team.
</I>
Several people on SWAML team we know you from other activities and
projects. How are you, Alvaro?

&gt;<i> Right now we are in the specification phase of a system that will gather
</I>&gt;<i> information from FLOSS projects information sources (Source code,
</I>&gt;<i> Defects and Issues, Mailing list, Documentation ...) and it will create
</I>&gt;<i> a semantic database for this contents. The final goal is to design a
</I>&gt;<i> system that will let the FLOSS project developer/user to search
</I>&gt;<i> semantically in all FLOSS project information sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have detected over 20 different information sources and we have
</I>&gt;<i> created ontologies for most of them. Now we need to gather information
</I>&gt;<i> from a selected group of this 20 sources. This gathered information will
</I>&gt;<i> be converted to a semantic format (RDF probably) using the ontologies
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Researching posible solutions we have found SWAML project that it is
</I>&gt;<i> very close to the idea we had for mailing list data sources. 
</I>
It's a great news. Mailing lists are a rich data sources, specially in
Free Software projects. 

&gt;<i> Do you know if there are some problems with the actual version of buxon
</I>&gt;<i> and this version of RDFlib?
</I>
Firstly thank you for your bug report. As Nacho says, it seems a RDFLib
backward compatibility problem, because it works fine using 2.3.3
version). I have opened a bug [1], and I'll try to fix it when I has
some time. Of course you'll have news about it on this mailing list.

&gt;<i> At the end we need to integrate in our Semantic Framework (RDF store,
</I>&gt;<i> Query engine, reasoner and inference server) all the developments for
</I>&gt;<i> the different information sources so we can integrate all of them in a
</I>&gt;<i> semantic way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We plan to have SWAML project as a prototype of a possible way to follow
</I>&gt;<i> in implementing the information source data to RDF store path. 
</I>
That are great news! Please, talk a little bit more about your project
and where SWAML could help you.

&gt;<i> Congratulations for the project!
</I>
Thank you!

Best regards,
