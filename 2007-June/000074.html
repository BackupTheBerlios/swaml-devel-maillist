&gt;<i> Time to play with it ;-) (rev 858) It works perfectly right now.
</I>
Great :-)

&gt;<i> The progress bar reload itself several times. Is it not possible to make
</I>&gt;<i> it indicate the real global progress?
</I>
It's impossible to the size of the graph when the Buxon begins to crawl
the files. BTW, I have to improve the progress bar, because it is done
when I was a newbie in PyGTK.

&gt;<i> The memory usage with large archives could be an issue to have in
</I>&gt;<i> account. With the URL above currently the memory usage is:
</I>
Yes, memory usage is a important issue, because now Buxon loads into
memory all the graph (around 100k triples for demo mailing list).

&gt;<i> I have seen also that you have added &quot;apps/prototypes/sparql-endpoint&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you plan to start working in the sparql-endpoint then? Do you have a
</I>&gt;<i> roadmap for it?
</I>
Yes, we have some plans in this way, indeed it would improve the memory
usage. But I'm sorry, for the moment I can't give you a roadmap. Watch
this space.

&gt;<i> About swaml, do you plan to leave the UI code in it or the plan is
</I>&gt;<i> moving it to buxom?
</I>
Yes, we have plans to remove the dependency between Buxon and SWAML.
When I'd start to write Buxon, it was only a prototype into SWAML. But
we have still not had time to really separate them. But don't worry,
this task will be finished for the next release, and all these code will
be moved to the correct module.

&gt;<i> Great work Sergio and all the swaml team!
</I>
Thank you! Please, tell to us about the advances with SWAML in the
QualiPSo project.

Regards,
