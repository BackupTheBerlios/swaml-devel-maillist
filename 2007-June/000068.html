<PRE>Hi!

El mi&#233;, 13-06-2007 a las 23:00 +0200, Sergio Fern&#225;ndez escribi&#243;: 
&gt;<i> &gt; Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My name is Alvaro del Castillo and I am coordinating the QualiPSo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A4 activity in URJC GSyC/LibreSoft team.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Several people on SWAML team we know you from other activities and
</I>&gt;<i> projects. How are you, Alvaro?
</I>
Great! Yes, I think I have met also some of you from other projects in
FLOSS world. I have been with Ivan Frade for example last Guademy in A
Coru&#241;a :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now we are in the specification phase of a system that will gather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information from FLOSS projects information sources (Source code,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Defects and Issues, Mailing list, Documentation ...) and it will create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a semantic database for this contents. The final goal is to design a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system that will let the FLOSS project developer/user to search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantically in all FLOSS project information sources.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have detected over 20 different information sources and we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; created ontologies for most of them. Now we need to gather information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from a selected group of this 20 sources. This gathered information will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be converted to a semantic format (RDF probably) using the ontologies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined in the project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Researching posible solutions we have found SWAML project that it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very close to the idea we had for mailing list data sources. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a great news. Mailing lists are a rich data sources, specially in
</I>&gt;<i> Free Software projects. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Sure, in GSyC/LibreSoft we are using them in our studies about FLOSS
projects and for example, they have been critical in reports like
FLOSSImpact: <A HREF="http://www.flossimpact.eu/">http://www.flossimpact.eu/</A>
(<A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf</A>)

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you know if there are some problems with the actual version of buxon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and this version of RDFlib?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly thank you for your bug report. As Nacho says, it seems a RDFLib
</I>&gt;<i> backward compatibility problem, because it works fine using 2.3.3
</I>&gt;<i> version). I have opened a bug [1], and I'll try to fix it when I has
</I>&gt;<i> some time. Of course you'll have news about it on this mailing list.
</I>
Great! If we have time we will play with it a bit. It is a nice
motivation for studying the code and to understand how you are using
technologies and libraries. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the end we need to integrate in our Semantic Framework (RDF store,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Query engine, reasoner and inference server) all the developments for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the different information sources so we can integrate all of them in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantic way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We plan to have SWAML project as a prototype of a possible way to follow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in implementing the information source data to RDF store path. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That are great news! Please, talk a little bit more about your project
</I>&gt;<i> and where SWAML could help you.
</I>
We are now defining a methodology to analyze each information source we
have detected in FLOSS projects. The actual draft for it is:

1. Create a card for the information source from D4.1.3, D4.2.1 and
D4.2.2 including: 
              * D4.1.3: Description, Format and licenses
              * D4.2.1: Ontologies that model the source
              * D4.2.2: Tools to manage the source
     2. Describe the general architecture with the information flow in
        the source.
     3. Research the tools for gathering the information from the
        information source (maybe some from D4.2.2).
     4. Describe the information source selected format and the mapping
        to the ontology concepts.
     5. Automatic semantic annotation for the source.
     6. Describe tools modification for adding semantic information.
     7. Describe the final semantic information model that will be
        stored in the semantic store and the relations with ontologies.
     8. Propose an implementation plan to develop and integrate the
        tools in QualiPSo A4 Semantic Framework.
     9. Execute the plan in an iterative way.


In this methodology SWAML could be used for mailing lists in 3, 4, 5 and
7. One of our main goals is at the end to have a semantic search
interface. For that we are researching to have SPARQL endpoints for all
the information sources contents. Also, we are researching reasoning
engines for more advanced information finding. Right now I am not sure
how far SWAML is in this areas.

Kind regards

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Congratulations for the project!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
