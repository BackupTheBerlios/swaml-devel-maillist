                  The First International Workshop on
              Data Semantics in Social Computing Systems 
                              (DiSCo `08) 
                        affiliated with OTM 2008

Motivation

The Social Web, Web 2.0, and Social Information Systems are emerging as
a promising new paradigm for large-scale distributed data management, as
can be seen in the success of Web-based social networks (e.g., Facebook,
MySpace), online social media sites (e.g., YouTube, Flickr), and
large-scale information sharing communities (e.g., Wikipedia, Yahoo!
Answers). At the same time, these applications also experience
boundaries in terms of information dissemination and automation.
Orthogonally, the Semantic Web has received considerable attention as a
next-generation Web of meaning, augmenting the Web as a linked
information space in which data is enriched and formalized. The Semantic
Web provides mediation support and lets users engage in serendipitous
reuse, discovery and maintenance of Web information. As more social
applications require the exchange of data, there arises a need for a
universal social networking layer on the Web that requires a flexible
and universal data exchange formalism. The combination of Social
Computing Systems (mainly Web 2.0) and the Semantic Web could utilize
the advantages of these approaches to address the the current challenges
on the Web. 

The goal of this workshop is to examine the key data management research
challenges at the intersection of Social Computing Systems and the
Semantic Web, to promote novel research in the area of data semantics
for Social Computing Systems, and to identify the state-of-the-art
technologies, applications, and systems for successfully enabling the
next generation of the Web. This workshop aims to bring together
researchers, industry affiliates, and practitioners from the fields of
databases, information systems, Social Web, Semantic Web and distributed
systems. The program of the workshop will be a combination of invited
talks, presentations of research papers, and discussions to foster
interaction and exchange of ideas among participants. In addition to
standard Q&amp;A sessions, we also expect to have at least one panel
discussion. 

We solicit original papers reporting practical approaches addressing
current existing problems, efforts leading to broaden social
involvement, work-in-progress on the preliminary ideas and visions,
demos and various system implementations. 

Topics of Interest

Topics of interest may include (but not limited): 
      * Architectures, protocols, and enabling technologies for social
        information systems;
      * Data management and middleware support for social information
        systems;
      * Data mining and knowledge discovery;
      * Data modeling for social information systems;
      * Distributed data storage and indexing;
      * Enterprise social information systems;
      * Identity on the Web;
      * Incentives for social semantics;
      * Integration of linked open data;
      * Integration of social information systems with traditional data
        management systems;
      * Privacy protection in social information systems;
      * Query languages and query optimization;
      * Social evaluation (social-metrics) for Social Semantics;
      * Social features of Social Semantics;
      * Social gaming for Social Semantics;
      * Social mediation (e.g., Community driven approach or
        instance-based approach for data and ontology mediation, etc.);
      * Social semantics for data contextualization;
      * Social semantics for data query and search;
      * Social semantics for (facet) browsing and visualization;
      * Social semantics for link analysis;
      * Social semantics for services mashups;
      * Social semantics recommender systems, user profiling,
        collaborative filtering;
      * Social spam detection and mitigation;
      * Social tagging;
      * Trust and uncertainty in social information systems;
      * Theoretical and technological combination of Semantic Web and
        Social Web;
      * XML database and integration;

conference.

All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of
the program committee. All submissions must be in English. Submissions
must not exceed 10 pages in the final camera-ready paper style and
should be submitted in PDF format. Detailed formatting instructions can
